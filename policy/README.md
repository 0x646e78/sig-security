# CNCF Security SIG Policy Team Introduction

## Background

When SAFE WG was originally proposed, developers from Kubernetes Policy WG
actively participated the discussions and then proposed CNCF level Policy WG was
[merged](../policy-wg-merging.md) with SAFE WG to form the current CNCF Security
SIG, in alignment with the SIG [charter](../governance/charter.md).

## Policy team

The Policy Team in CNCF Security SIG consists of the same set of developers that
forms the [Kubernetes Policy WG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-policy). 
The only difference is the topic coverage (whether it is at Kubernetes level or
CNCF level).

There are now two active co-leads for Policy Team @hannibalhuang and @ericavonb.
The Policy Team is under the overall [governance](../governance/roles.md) of the
CNCF Security SIG and should not be viewed as a separate entity. All policy
related contributions are welcomed to be made to the sig-security repo if needed
.

## Work
One of the major output of the team effort is the [cloud native policy
white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1StDYW1zHVSF1Qswk0ScsyKw766AbAHOikyCNtqCsMMY/edit?usp=sharing)

The current top priority development work are 
- [policy formal verification](./overview-policy-formal-verification.md)
- [Policy Violation CRD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QJWcaJdo8w88tIixiZp9zBMHKghTMrHTyHyk6xcoVhk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Contact
The team could be reached via either k8s slack channel #wg-policy or cncf slack
channel #sig-security.
